## üìù Overview

Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts or locks files and demands a ransom to restore access. This repository demonstrates a **non-encrypting** example of ransomware behavior by recursively "locking" files in a directory using a file rename operation (adding a `.locked` extension). 

### Key Features:
- Recursively processes all files in a directory and subdirectories.
- Adds a `.locked` extension to files to simulate "locking."
- Skips directories and special entries like `.` and `..`.

## üíª Code Explanation

### Functions:
1. **`lock_file(const wchar_t* filename)`**  
   Attempts to rename a given file by appending the `.locked` extension. Reports errors if the file cannot be renamed.

2. **`lock_directory(const wchar_t* dir_name)`**  
   Recursively traverses a directory. Processes all files and subdirectories, calling `lock_file` for files and `lock_directory` for subdirectories.

3. **`main()`**  
   Prompts the user to input the directory to "lock" and calls `lock_directory` to process all files.
